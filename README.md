# Everything Open 2024
Here we'll work on getting a notebook going for the Everything Open workshop. We'll borrow heavily from the ATLAS Open Data notebooks, and make an emphasis on:
1. Obtaining data for yourself
2. Making some simple selections
3. Re-plotting the Higgs bump

The idea is that we'll copy the Open Data tutes into some directory, build our own notebook using that as a close reference, keep in mind that the target audience are not physicists, and boil this down to something fun!

When we're happy with the notebook, we'll fork it and throw it into some Google Colab link that can be accessed publicly.
