    "In particular, it looks like we want to emphasize:\n",
    "## 1. Obtaining Open Data\n",
    "So things like how to acquire it, how to unpack it, what tools (packages) do you need...\n",
    "## 2. Looking at observables\n",
    "This would be things like listing off the tree keys (i.e. all the distributions that **can be plotted**), but also how to **apply selection strings, make cuts**, etc.\n",
    "## 3. Reconstructing the Higgs\n",
    "Once an idea of what we have is understood, we can show the maths to get $m_{\\gamma\\gamma}$, reconstructing the 2012 discovery of the Higgs Boson."
